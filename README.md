# Turing completeness of prompting

The implementation of the constructed Transformer is in `main.ipynb`.

We provided two examples:

1. Computing the Parity function: the XOR of all input bits.
2. Deciding the Dyck language: balanced parenthesis sequences (`0` as `(`, `1` as `)`).

Please feel free to try more examples by modifying the code. 

**Note:** If you see wrong answers (`WA`), please increase the precision of floating-point operations (`args.fp_round` and `args.fp_guard`).

More descriptions are coming soon...
